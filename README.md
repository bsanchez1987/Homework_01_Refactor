##Changes Made to HTML and CSS

The HTML and CSS elements had many redundancies as well as div tags that didn't label the contents well
DIV tags were changed to better categorize the sections of the HTML and label them more accurately as well as removed class and id tags that were unnecessary to eliminate clutter
Also changed the CSS to better target the recently changed DIV tags as well as organized the order of the CSS elements to be more inline with HTML

##What I Learned

I learned how to better manage semantic elements as well as how to organize the css elements and eliminate redundancies for a more organized layout
